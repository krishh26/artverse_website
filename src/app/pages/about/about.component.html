        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <div class="story-text">
          <p>
            ArtVerse was born from a simple belief: art and culture should be accessible, 
            inclusive, and celebrated in all their forms. What started as a small gathering 
            of artists and art enthusiasts has grown into a vibrant platform that connects 
            creators, learners, and culture lovers.
          </p>
          <p>
            We curate workshops, festivals, flea markets, and creative events that bring 
            together diverse communities. From traditional pottery techniques to contemporary 
            street art, from intimate gallery shows to large-scale cultural festivals—we 
            create spaces where creativity thrives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission is to break down barriers between artists and audiences, between 
            tradition and innovation, between different cultures and perspectives. ArtVerse 
            is where these worlds meet, creating something beautiful together.

        <h2>Why ArtVerse Exists</h2>
        <p class="mission-text">
          In a world that often feels disconnected, art has the power to bring us together. 
          ArtVerse exists to create those moments of connection—through shared experiences, 
          collaborative creation, and cultural celebration.
        </p>
        <p class="mission-text">
          We're not just organizing events; we're building a movement. A movement that 
          values handcrafted expression over mass production, authentic culture over 
          commercial trends, and community over competition.
